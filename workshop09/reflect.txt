professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

FINAL REFLECTION FOR OOP244:
In final project, I have learned to implement concepts of OOP that we had 
learned in this course so far like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism 
by using hierachy structure of classes by inherting base class functionalities 
from iProduct module to derived classes in item and perishable module, 
overloading various operators to configure object behaviour with operators, 
overriding methods behaviour using virtual functions and to use various 
standard libraries like "iomanip", "fstream", "sstream", "ctime", "limits" 
etc., using libraries helps us to add more functionalities easily. Moreover, 
I learned I/O file operations to read and write data from and into files and 
boost my understanding of filehandling in programming. In addition to that, I 
learned how to write code for large applications like this and how to overcome 
challenges. Although, I believe that i have work more harder to learn and 
explore this concepts even more in detail with it's wide usage spectrum.


The final project help us to apply all the key concepts that we understood and 
explain by professor in this course. Basically, this project is mixture of all 
workshop that help us to apply all our understanding of language and it's 
conceptsforcing us to think critically and implement it in actual working code. 
The first part is building block of application in which we get familiar with 
requirements of application and Started by creating Status and Date module and 
using Utils for Additional utility functions, with milestone progresses we added 
more modules such as menu, AidMan, iProduct, Item and Perishable. However, the 
last milestone 5 is one of most challenging for me as it require all module to 
function properly and interact with each other to get the required result. 
Ignoring the challenges and time needed for completing it lead to delayed 
submission of milestones 5 parts and still I am working on last part which is 
almost complete. Overall, the course is very comphrehensive to cover the 
concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming along with theroy resources and notes, 
workships and exercise. Although it might be difficult for students who do not 
have any programming background and learning OOP for first time, guidance from 
professor and college resources can help one to grab the conceptsquickly and 
apply in workshops and project.
