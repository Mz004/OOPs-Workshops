This week workshop helps in understanding completely new concepts of 
member operators to encapsulate data and also helps to understand usage of 
helper functions in more depth.Member operators are basically a functions 
that overloads operator that allows us to define the behavior of standard 
operators when used with objects of a user-defined class. It helps us to 
enhance readability and usability by costomizing behavior that fits the 
best for our class. Moreover, in this workshop we uses binary operators 
that operate on two operands, Type conversion operators that allow implicit
or explicit conversion between the class type and another type, Unary 
operators which operate on a single operand. In D.I.Y part, protfolio 
module help me in developing better understanding of encapsulation of 
data and activity witin class. Also, The significance of operator 
overloading to alter class actions according to our requirements 
can be seen by using overloaded operators as member global functions.
