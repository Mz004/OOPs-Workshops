This workshop helps me to understand constructors and destructors in more 
details along with pointer members. By completing this workshop, I came to know 
that default constructor is a constructor that is automatically called when an object 
is created. It doesn't take any arguments, and used to initialize the object's data 
members like we did in both part. Moreover, I learned about overloaded constructor 
which is a constructor that takes parameters. This allows us to create objects with 
different initial states based on the values we provide while creating an object.
Also, this worshop helps me to dive deeper in destructor which is a special member 
function that is called when an object goes out of scope and used to perform cleanup
activities like releasing memory or files. 

Apart from constructors and destructors, I now know exactly how to initialize member
variables using constructors and member pointer that points to data members and 
member functions. I felt that pointer member is somewhat more complex than regular 
pointers which i believe becomes easier with practice.
