In this week's workshop, I learned more in details about dynamic memory allocation 
as we already learn about concept of dynamic memory in workshop 01. This workshop 
helps me to strengthen concepts from previous week along with introduction to 
dynamic memory allocation/deallocation, member functions alonhg with private and 
public keywords and privacy as well as memory leak. For me, reading from course 
notes is quite challenging as i find it difficult to understand concept reading it. 
However, After reading multiple times i was able to implement them in workshop. 
Apart from this, I understood some concepts of manually handling and dealing with 
memory using C++ which helps us to design programs with more efficiency saving time 
and save which is one of most important aspect of programming.
From this workshop 2, I came to know about function overloading, when, why and how 
to use it. Furthermore, using boolean type function and loading data from files and 
allocate memory dynamically to arrays was one of lastest learning from this week.
Also, I Learned basis of how to create reference and use it to modify the content of 
variables in other scopes to get the required work done.
At last, I still have to partice alot to get my hands-on this concepts as we cannot 
spare such amount of time in coding such small programs in real world. So, more 
practice always helps to clear concepts in more depth.
