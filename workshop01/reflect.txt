Part 1 of workshop 01 is simple as compared to part 2 in my opinion due to provided 
step by step instruction to achieve required output. However, workshop leads to clear 
concepts of using namespace, compliling using g++, exploring modular programming and
file handling in more detail. Moreover, Part 2(D.I.Y) requires more time and effort 
than part 1 which is obvious as it forces us to think more critically to solve specific 
problems to deal with text files. This workshop helps in building strong foundation for 
upcoming concepts we would learn and practice in OOP workshops. In part one, Designing 
function to perform specific task is most challenging part like converting text to lower 
case, copy it and use it with other modules while in part two, handling text file to 
achieve required output is one of most tedious for me. I think ,OOP will help me to 
better understand the concepts of programming that are not as cleared in previous term. 
At last, course notes are very  helpful along with lectures to fully understand the 
topics and play important role in building solutions for workshops.
